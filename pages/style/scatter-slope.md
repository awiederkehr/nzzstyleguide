Scatterplots can be a great way to show correlation between variables. Keep in mind however, that they are not intuitive for all audiences and can appear to be quite complex. Use labeling an annotation in the following ways to help provide guidance and a comfortable entry point.

## Axis Labeling

Lower the barriers by summarizing the dimensions used at a highly visible place. For better accessibility use everyday language and be more precise in the footnote or methodology section.

```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_axislabeling@1x.png 1x, assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_axislabeling@2x.png 2x"
```

## Annotations

Often, we want to highlight interesting correlation in a scatterplot. Annotate data points directly as long as the text field doesn't up other important data. Should the annotation be longer and require more space, use connection lines to annotate the points from outside the chart. Use titles to group multiple annotations. Don't draw extra elements to highlight groups, while this tends to unnecessarily overclutter the chart.

```

plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_annotations-print@1x.png 1x, assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_annotations-print@2x.png 2x"
```

## Slopes
We use slope charts typically to show the change of data by displaying two points in time. These are excellent alternatives to the line chart, when we want to give our readers a more precise message. Keep date labels at the top of the slope chart, so that in the case of a tall graphic, the reader understands the time frame without having to scroll.
