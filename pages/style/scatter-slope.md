Scatterplots can be a great way to show correlation between variables. Keep in mind however, that they are not intuitive for all audiences and can appear to be quite complex. Use labeling an annotation in the following ways to help provide guidance. 

## Axis Labeling

We offer our readers a comfortable entry point to complex graphics like scatterplots. Lower the barriers by summarizing the dimensions used at a highly visible place. For better accessibility use everyday language and be more precise elsewhere/later.

```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_axislabeling@1x.png 1x, assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_axislabeling@2x.png 2x"
```

## Annotations

We often want to highlight interesting dots in a scatterplot. Annotate dots directly as long as the text field doesn't cover other dots. Use conncetion lines to annotate the dots from outside. Use titles to group multiple annotations.

```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_annotations@1x.png 1x, assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_annotations@2x.png 2x"
```

```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_annotations-print@1x.png 1x, assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_annotations-print@2x.png 2x"
```

## Slopes
