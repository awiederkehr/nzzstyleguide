As an advanced version, the building stands out from the backround. After finding the best possible perspective in Google Earth Pro, the screenshot will be further processed in Adobe Photoshop. First retouch the photo by taking out the backround. Soften the backorund by using 5% of Gaussian Blur (Gaußscher Weichzeichner). Then place a 40% transparent, white layer over the backround. Also retouch the logo and texts on the screenshot and instead mention the source in Q respectively underneath the graphic in the print version. For all further additions in the picture like text and coloured layers please orientate in our styleguide definitions.
